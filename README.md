Web Dev Assessment Project: Showcase of responsive design, chatbot integration, and content security. Explore the code and comprehensive document


Introduction
I embarked on this project as part of my skill assessment for a web and front-end development role The task involved using provided media to create a cohesive website design, allowing me to showcase my technical skills and creative approach.


Tools and Resources
I utilized Visual Studio Code for development, enhanced with plugins like Live Server for real-time page reloading and CSS Peak for CSS management. My development process included reusing code snippets from past projects for efficiency. Bootstrap for responsive styling and Boxicons for icons were used, organized in the 'vendor' folder.
Implementation and Features


The website was designed with a focus on intuitively navigable features, supporting both mobile and large screens. A key feature was the gallery or slideshow, which displayed images in a unified context. 
In addition, I want to mention that, given the images provided, I assumed the website's content would revolve around professional photography. This led me to conduct extensive research on photography websites to ensure that the design and features aligned with industry standards and user expectations. This research guided my choices in terms of layout, content placement, and the overall aesthetic of the website. It allowed me to create a website that not only met the assessment's requirements but also catered to the specific needs and preferences of a photography-focused audience
To enhance content security, right-clicking on images was disabled. Additionally, I integrated a basic chatbot for user interaction and flexibility.


Challenges and Solutions

The development process presented various challenges, each serving as a valuable learning experience. Solutions such as smooth background image transitions and a fixed logo position were implemented. A dark mode toggle was also integrated for improved user experience.

Project Start-Up

To view the project, start the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code, which automatically opens the webpage, showcasing the implemented features and design.

Limitations
The project faced some limitations due to it running l
ocally and not on a web server. This affected certain integrations and functionalities that are ideally tested in a live web environment.



Conclusion

This project was an extensive demonstration of my web development skills, emphasizing my ability to blend technical proficiency with creative solutions. It highlighted my adaptability, problem-solving skills, and personal style, crucial for a role in web and front-end development.
